Ulendo Software (Smart 3D printing)
**********

``Ulendo`` can be used on low cost embedded systems microcontroller. We coded the method in C and shared the libraries here on Github; you can use them in any distribution or transfer them into any programing language to use them on your own systems.

The software contains two parts: 

- A software with the vibration compensation method that runs on an embedded system; 
- A modified Marlin firmware.

Preparation 
============

- Hardware:
	 + Raspberry Pi 3 Model B/B+
	 + USB Printer Cable 
	 + Monitor, Mouse and Keyboard for the Raspberry Pi
	 
 
Architectures

Configuration
============

- Marlin Firmware:
	 + Flash the modified Marlin firmware to the board on the printer.
	 + You can follow the instructions from http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html

- Ulendo Software:
	 + Download the “Raspbian Buster with desktop” from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
	 + Flash the IMG file into the Raspberry Pi
	 + Download the Ulendo Software with Github, and you will find the software in your home folder:

.. code:: shell

	$ git clone https://github.com/luxiangnk/Ulendo.git
	


Run the code
============

- Make sure the Raspberry Pi is connected to the internet.


- Make sure the printer's board appears as /dev/ttyACM0, you can check it with:

.. code:: shell

	$ ls -l /dev/ttyACM*


- Modify the Makefile based on your own system especially the path and version (python3.5 in our case) of Python as:

.. code:: shell

	-I/usr/include/python3.5m/ -L/usr/lib/ -lpython3.5m


- Then you can build the project and make sure there are no errors after typing:

.. code:: shell

	$ cd ~/Ulendo/RPI
	$ make


- Run the code by typing:

.. code:: shell

	$ ./main

- Select "Print with Ulendo->Start" from your printer's screen.

- The code will check the license first and it will take several seconds before printing.

- You can read the comments in the code if you want to call the APIs from the shared object file.

- If you want to change the Gcode, you can put your own Gcode in the folder of "RPI/Gcodes/Printing/" and make sure there is only one Gcode file in the folder.

- If you want to change printing parameters, you select "Print with Ulendo->Setting" from the printer's screen.


About LPFBS
============

**The limited-preview filtered B-spline (LPFBS) approach minimizes errors in tracking long-duration desired trajectories which may or may not be entirely known a priori.** 

You can read the MECH17 paper or contact me (Xiang Lu)
if you want to learn more about the LPFBS algorithm.

You can download the paper from `<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320114918_A_limited-preview_filtered_B-spline_approach_to_tracking_control_-_With_application_to_vibration-induced_error_compensation_of_a_3D_printer>`_
